## Overview
HavenOverflow is a small security research group dedicated to the discovering and documentation of vulnerabilities and software development in various products manufactured by Google.

Exploits and software are released with the idea of keeping people aware and devices secure, but also as open as possible for people looking to make modifications where there would typically be restrictions in place. We look to documenting these findings thoroughly and pushing them to their absolute limits to make them as accessible and open as possible.
