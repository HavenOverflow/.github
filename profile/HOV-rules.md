# Member Expectations and Rules
The following is a set of rules and guidelines required to be adhered by all HavenOverflow members, in public or private servers. By joining any HavenOverflow-owned and operated server or organization, you are agreeing to and subject to all of the following guidelines for the categories you fall under, and accept that failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in disciplinary action toward you or any others involved.

## General Guidelines
_The following are guidelines designed to maintain a welcoming and friendly environment for HavenOverflow owned servers and all members of said servers._

- No demeaning, hateful, or disrespectful speech of any kind. This will not be tolerated under any circumstances. This includes slurs, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, harassment of any kind, etc.

- If you are to hold someone to an expectation for respect, it is expected you are to be held to the same expectation. In other words, don't by a hypocrate or a dick.

- No content that is considered NSFW (Not Safe For Work) will be tolerated. First time offenses will be a warning, and punishment will be enacted for future offenses.

- No doxxing or leaking of personal information to an individual by which was not directly permitted by the person(s) in question will be tolerated. If a user accidentally leaks sensitive information belonging to themselves or others, it is not to be reposted **anywhere** or you will be punished with a lengthy mute or a ban.

- Suicide encouragement is either a lengthy mute and warning or instant ban. I don't care if this is a joke or not, telling people to kill themselves will not be tolerated.

- Follow COPPA rules, and do not violate any digital or real-life laws. Failure to comply will result in a warning and then a ban in event of further pushback.

- Have general respect for other members of this server. Disputes should not be handled violently, and if there is a genuine issue please involve a staff member to handle it accordingly.

- Do not disregard or dismiss anybody's opinion regardless of if it is misaligned with yours. Everybody has different ideas and beliefs, please respect that.

- It is heavily requested you maintain common sense and follow the conduct requested here in other servers, even if they are not subject to the same criteria, to prevent internal drama.

## Server Integrity Guidelines
_The following are security guidelines designed to protect HavenOverflow owned servers and all members of said servers, as well as their contents._

- No alternative accounts will be permitted to ensure group integrity. Should you desire to utilize an account that is not your main, you may temporarily join on it and your main account will be kicked until further notice, but this is non-negotiable.

- In the event your account is compromised, see to it that a staff member is alerted as quickly as possible, and your account will be kicked from the server and stripped of its permissions until the issue is resolved.

- If any user deletes a message, it is not to be reposted without consent of the user unless for the purpose of moderation (in which only a staff member should ever be doing so). Failure to comply may result in a warning or a mute depending on the severity of the content.

- Please exclude this server from any Hidden Channel & Message Logger plugins if you have them. This is non-negotiable, and failure to comply will result in a ban.

## HavenOverflow Member Guidelines
_The following are guidelines specific to offical members of HavenOverflow or members inside the HavenOverflow private development server._

- No public disclosure or disclosure to non-permitted individuals (regardless of your trust to them) of any information, images, code, etc _from private projects and channels_ is permissible without direct approval from an **owner** of HavenOverflow. Failure to comply with this rule will result in a mute or a ban from all HavenOverflow servers and services depending on the content disclosed. 

- Any and all information unintended to be disclosed to the public or specific individuals that is revealed despite its access restrictions is to be reported to a staff member immediately and not to be given any form of public attention unless otherwise peritted by staff as damage control or another reasoning.

- Any and all development of private projects between two or more indivisuals should _preferably_ be done within their respective channels. To accomodate members who prefer to work more privately, this will not be strictly enforced, however it will be asked if you do so that you keep all members associated with the project in development updated regularly about changes and updates.

- Votes on decisions made for the additions of new members, democratic changes to the server, and any other poll in which all members are requested to vote are mandatory.

- All decisions made in any poll for the addition of new members, democratic changes to the server, or any other vote of importance must contain a justification of your vote in order to prove an understanding of the decision in question and to prevent the process from being ignored.

- A member of HavenOverflow or any HavenOverflow-owned server should never in any manner sacrifice their own physical or mental needs for the benefit of the group. Your health will always take priority over any project being developed in HavenOverflow.

- Furthermore expanding on the rule above, a member of HavenOverflow or any HavenOverflow-owned server should never in any manner do anything that would disrupt the daily life of themselves or others, or influence things that may cause them trouble in a school or parental setting.

- All punishments are subject to change varying on the severity of the issue at hand. Do not be mistaken that the only punishments mentioned are all that may happen, see them more as what is likely to happen as opposed to what will.

- Any private information trusted is not to be placed on any data servers that are not HavenOverflow-operated. This may result in malicious actors taking said data, and is categorized as public disclosure, and subject to the same punishments as such. 

- If you are using a remote workstation or if someone other than you has access to your workstation, you MUST make this known to ALL staff, and **ENCRYPTION OF THE ENTIRE DISK AND/OR HOME DIRECTORY IS MANDATORY!!! NON-OPTIONAL!!!** It will also be REQUIRED your password to unlock said encryption **IS NOT SHARED** with **ANY** other individuals without express permission.

- If only you have access to your workstation, encryption is optional, but still HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

- If your workstation is not owned _directly by you_, you **may not store ANY private projects on it without express permission from _ALL OWNERS_, regardless of encryption!**

- There may be occasional security checkups to verify the integrity of all workstations performed by staff to prevent unauthorized access.

- Lying about security questions and/or avoiding checkups may result in probation of your role and/or punishment.

- In the event any of the above workstation requirements cannot be met, your access to private projects will be restricted.

## HavenOverflow Staff Guidelines
_The following are guidelines specific to staff members and moderators of HavenOverflow and all HavenOverflow-owned servers._

- Any and all MUTE punishment cases must be justified and proof of an offense to one of the guidelines applied to the target user must be provided.

- Any and all BAN or KICK punishment cases **must** go through owners first, must be justified, and proof of an offense to one of the guidelines applied to the target user must be provided.

- Creation or modification of channels and channel/post privileges should not be made without informing an owner prior to doing so.

- Any channels that are to be retired are to be moved to a specific archive category only accessible to staff unless otherwise instructed by an owner.

## HavenOverflow Owner Guidelines
_The following are guidelines specific to owners of HavenOverflow and all HavenOverflow-owned servers._

- Only an owner (on a unanimous agreement between all other owners) may publicly disclose a private project in any designated location.

- Increases of user access levels through the tier system must be a unanimous agreement among all server owners.

- Any and all changes to the guidelines, rules, and/or group structure and integrity must be a unanimous agreement among all owners.

- All announcements and/or decisions should be properly communicated with all 3 owners and preferably (albeit unrequired) staff before continuing. Even if the idea in question is of no harm, communication is crucial. 

- In the event it is decided among a majority (through any party in the group, Staff, Members, or other Owners) that an owner's behaviour is resulting in harm to the group's integrity and/or public reception, disciplinary action such as suspension from their title and/or expulsion from the group in its entirety may be done to quell the situation. 

- To prevent leaks from occuring in the event disciplinary action is taken against an owner, information related to private projects may be halted and/or relocated to prevent further malicious public disclosure from occuring.

# Group Structure and Integrity
The following is a set of guidelines and organizational structures for the foundation of the HavenOverflow group. This section is designed to create a stable group structure for managing members' access to certain materials, maximizing productivity, and creating a safe environment.

## Base Goal
_The following are structures utilized in HavenOverflow and all HavenOverflow-owned servers designed to establish a general mission that should serve as a motivation and leading goal behind the existence of the group as well as a mission for all projects that surface from it._

- HavenOverflow is designed to be primarily a security research, development, and reverse engineering group.

- The main targets of development from our groups is targetting that of Google-manufactured devices, however the primary target is typically Chromebooks due to their unique and powerful (if utilized correctly) nature.

- The servers associated with HavenOverflow are designed to be safe spaces for all members to interact with each other freely and kindly while also doubling as a simple, secure, and productive research and development environment for all kinds of work. 

## Access System
_The following are structures utilized in HavenOverflow and all HavenOverflow-owned servers designed to ensure the security and integrity of the group while also allowing individuals with less trust than others to work alongside everyone else with minimal restrictions outside of basic access._

- Basic organization access should be restricted by a member role; to prevent breaches in the event an invite is ever disclosed to the public, all channels and private project access should be restricted to staff-granted roles that are never to be granted to non-members of the organization.

- Member interactions will be operated primarily on Discord, and code bases will be stored on GitHub.

- All projects should be divided among a 3 tier system; 3 being the highest, 1 being the lowest.

- Tier 1 projects should be reserved as public projects; typically websites or utilities that hold little value if disclosed to the public. This is the most basic access level, given to all official members of HavenOverflow, and should be utilized as a layer for testing the reliability and trustworthiness of new individuals as well as how well they operate in interaction with other members of the private and public servers.

- Tier 2 projects should be reserved as less severe vulnerabilities; typically exploits that can compromise a sandboxxed or non-persistent region of the device, or cannot be utilized to gain code execution of any compromising manner. This is the second level of trust, given usually to people building trust within the private development server.

- Tier 3 projects should be reserved as severe vulnerabilities; exploits or ideas that if disclosed to the public could be considered to cause damage to Google or other involved corporations or organizations, or vulnerabilities that can be utilized to seize complete control of a system in an otherwise completely and fully unintended by the original product design. This the highest level of trust, given only to those who have displayed for an extended period of time a large level of trustworthiness and/or dedication to development.

## Management System
_The following are structures utilized in HavenOverflow and all HavenOverflow-owned servers designed to ensure a stable management and a fully democratic process of operation that should remain impossible to be tied under any circumstances._

- All servers should have at most and preferably 3 owners at one given time. 

- An owner of HavenOverflow or a HavenOverflow-owned server should have full management access to the entirety of whatever server is being managed, and should oversee the majority of significant server operations.

- All decisions made to change anything ranging from the member list, server operation, etc. must be a fully democratic process involving all staff, and if deemded necessary and preferable all official members of HavenOverflow as well.

- During the process of a democratic vote, any ties among a group should be divided among higher-up individuals, meaning if all members were to vote and tie, then the vote would be redone among staff, and if it should still tie it should be done among owners, to which a tie should be impossible so long as 3 owners are at all times present.

- In the event an owner should step down from their position, a new one should be voted upon amongst members and appointed with relative haste, with the exception being should nobody desire to fill the position, to which it shall remain empty until someone is in line to replace it.

## Public Disclosure System
_The following are structures utilized in HavenOverflow and all HavenOverflow-owned servers as well as servers by which group-developed projects are intended to be disclosed in designed to ensure a quick and simple process of public disclosure in means that best benefit the public and HavenOverflow from a public perception standpoint._

- Any and all projects, under any access level, are not to be disclosed to any public or private server, channel, etc. without direct permission from **ALL 3 OWNERS**.

- Any project that has any significant monetary value (the limit decided among staff) if provided to Google through the Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) over the Chromium/Android Bug Tracker is not to be publicly disclosed until the vulnerability in question has been fully and thoroughly reported and the disclosure window set by Google on the private bug closes.

- Any project that recieves monetary value from Google's Vulnerability Reward Program is to be divided among all _contributors_ evenly depending on their contributions to the project, negotiated among **all members**, not just staff.

## Development System
_The following are structures utilized in HavenOverflow and all HavenOverflow-owned servers designed to detail how public and/or private development should be done on various projects to ensrue integrity and keep operation as smooth and simple for all developers as possible._

- No alternate github accounts should ever be allowed on the github organization.

- The github organization should store all major projects officially branded from the group, and as such should not be developed on any other platform.

- The github organization should be split into the same access levels by which the HavenOverflow private development server is. All users in the organization should be split into their respective teams and no access levels should ever be exceeded in one location over the other.

- Preferably no git force pushing should ever be done to minimize the amount of conflicts needed to be corrected on other developer's ends. This should only ever be done in the event of a lack of other options or if directly permitted by a staff member.

- Members assigned with various tasks on a project should always take in consideration their capabilities and willingness; nobody should ever be requested something they are incapable of doing or unwilling to do.

## Member Induction System
_The following are structures utilized in HavenOverflow and all HavenOverflow-owned servers designed to detail how new members/recruits are inducted into HavenOverflow, as well as how access levels should be managed accordingly._

- All votes to induct members should be agreed upon by over 50% of the total member count of HavenOverflow's private development server. In the event of a tie, the poll will be redone among the next highest postition of access in the organization until a tie has been broken.

- All votes to induct members should originate as a poll among all members to perform an interview of the requested member, to which the requested member will be invited to a private channel in the HavenOverflow public server and questioned on their experience and abilities to be brought to the server should they be inducted.

- An interview should request a **detailed** description of an individual's talents, abilities, experience, personality, and more. The idea is the interview process should be performed to get to know a potential candidate better and learn about them more thoroughly before making a final decision.

- The final voting decision should be done privately among HavenOverflow members in a channel not visible to the interviewee, to which all votes must be a tally vote between -1 and +1 (and must be a multiple of 0.25, for simplicity), and must contain a full justification as to why they voted that value. After the voting period has closed or all members have casted and finalized their votes, the channel is to be permenantly archived, only visible to staff of HavenOverflow.

- No details about anybody's vote other than your own is to be disclosed to the interviewee, to which you are by no means obligated to do so. If you wish for your vote and/or reason to remain anonymous, you are fully within your jurisdiction to do so.

## Member Removal System
- In the event a member leaves the group, their contributions are still to be documented, however any potential rewards from vulnerabilities will no longer be distributed to them.

- In the event a member leaves the group, no private projects are to be redistributed to them under any circumstances unless approved by **all 3 owners**.

- All projects developed within the private development server are property of HavenOverflow, not the lead developer. By leaving the server, you are giving up any rights you have to access, own, or redistribute any code.

## Role System
_The following are structures utilized in HavenOverflow and all HavenOverflow-owned servers designed to detail how various special roles should be assigned to benefit the server from an integrity and PR standpoint._

- There should at all times be at least one or more individuals assigned with the lead development of a project, to maintain productivity and oversee a general design plan, where other people who have the ability to do so are given the proper tools to assist in development. This role however is not exclusive; and may be passed around if seen as necessary.

- There should at all times be at least one or more trustworthy individuals assigned with the ensuring of inregrity and security of the general group, to lead how accidental disclosure or 

- There should at all times be at least one or more trustworthy individuals assigned with the management of the public reception of the group as a whole, discussing ways it may be improved or expanded upon.

## Testing System

- If it is possible to avoid outside influence from individuals or groups that are not affiliated with HavenOverflow on a general trust level, then all measures should be taken to do so.

- In the event outside influence is required to proceed on a project, help should only be requested with permission from an **owner** and should include very minimal request and never a description of the project or reason behind the request unless otherwise permitted.

- In the event outside influence is required to test a project, which should be rare and usually only for projects of small scope or specific targets, then only the minimal and veiled resources to do so should be provided to the influence in question (only with permission from an **owner**) and if possible the primary reason for in question should be not inquired upon unless absolutely necessary.

# Special Roles
The following is a set of guidelines and expectations for special role assignments in HavenOverlow. This section is designed to organize people's skillsets and have a more productive and secure environment to discuss and develop.

## Public Receptions Manager
- A PR Manager's job is to ensure public reception of the group is as positive as possible, and if not discuss ways it can be improved.

- The owner of this role should preferably be someone who has a good judgement in public relations and a relatively clean slate in public associations, and good contact capabilities.

## Security Manager
- A Security Manager's job is to ensure private projects and information within the group do not get publicly disclosed, and in the event they are disclosed to ensure that the situation is handled appropriately and quickly.

- Unanticipated or malicious public disclosure should be handled directly through this manager. 

- The owner of this role should preferably be someone with a large number of public associations and contact capabilities, whilst also showing responsibility and accountabiltiy for actions of themselves and others.
